# Internet of Things
This repository contains Internet of Things (IoT) experiments and code examples using common protocols and tools. It includes implementations for device connectivity, sensor data collection and learning IoT fundamentals. A resource for students and enthusiasts exploring IoT concepts and connected systems.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Experiments

      LED Blinking
      Simple Button Interfacing
      Inspection of Voltage Variation with LDR
      Playing Melody with Buzzer
      Controlling DC Fan Motor
      Attaching an LCD
      Sending Data from NodeMCU to ThingSpeak

## üéØ Purpose
A compact, hands-on repository for learning practical IoT fundamentals through simple experiments and clear, reusable examples. Each experiment focuses on a single concept (sensors, actuators, interfacing or cloud telemetry) so learners can quickly build, test, and extend real IoT setups.

## üìå Usage
1. Clone the repository:

   git clone `https://github.com/RaianRashidRimon/Internet-Of-Things.git`
   
2. Open the desried code in Arduino IDE
3. Choose the appropriate board and port
4. Build the circuit as shown and upload the corresponding code to your board (or follow the Materials and Procedure PDF for detailed steps)
